# Cipher-Encryptoid

Web application that lets the users encrypt and decrypt texts inputted from an input text box or uploaded file. The user can select from a list of ciphers (Simple Substitution, Double Transposition, RC4) and specify if it needs encryption or decryption. The user also needs to create an account in order to access the application; the account credentials will be validated according to various requirements such as password length and proper email formatting. A database will be created that stores the information related to the user accounts (username, password and email) and the input texts from that specific user (if logged in), the cipher used and the timestamp at the moment of the creation of the record. Includes user authentication and a secure Session mechanism. Implemented using PHP for server-side web development and connection to the database, MySQL for database management, JavaScript for client-side validation, and HTML.
